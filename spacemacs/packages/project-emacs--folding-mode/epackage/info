Info:
Description: A folding-editor-like minor mode
 Folding mode handles a document as a tree, where each branch is
 bounded by special markers `{{{' and `}}}'. A branch can be placed
 inside another branch, creating a complete hierarchical structure.
 .
 To start folding mode, give the command: `M-x' `folding-mode'
 `RET'. The mode line should contain the string "Fld" indicating
 that folding mode is activated.
 .
 When loading a document containing fold marks, Folding mode is
 automatically started and all folds are closed. For example when
 loading my init file, only the following lines (plus a few lines
 of comments) are visible:
 .
     ;;{{{ General...
     ;;{{{ Keyboard...
     ;;{{{ Packages...
     ;;{{{ Major modes...
     ;;{{{ Minor modes...
     ;;{{{ Debug...
 .
 The concept and utility was created by Jamie Lokier in 1992.
