%% Modified 2015 December

%% This is a sample manuscript marked up using the
%% AASTeX v6.x LaTeX 2e macros.

%% AASTeX is now based on Alexey Vikhlinin's emulateapj.cls
%% (Copyright 2000-2015).  See the classfile for details.
%%
%% AASTeX requires revtex4-1.cls (http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/) and
%% other external packages (latexsym, graphicx, amssymb, longtable, and epsf).
%% All of these external packages should already be present in the modern TeX
%% distributions.  If not they can also be obtained at www.ctan.org.

%% The first piece of markup in an AASTeX v6.x document is the \documentclass
%% command. LaTeX will ignore any data that comes before this command. The
%% documentclass can take an optional argument to modify the output style.
%% The command below calls the preprint style  which will produce a tightly
%% typeset, one-column, single-spaced document.  It is the default and thus
%% does not need to be explicitly stated.
%%

%% using aastex version 6
\documentclass{aastex6}

%% \documentclass[twocolumn]{aastex6}

\usepackage{natbib}
% These are the available options:
%   manuscript	: onecolumn, doublespace, 12pt fonts
%   preprint	: onecolumn, single space, 10pt fonts
%   preprint2	: twocolumn, single space, 10pt fonts
%   twocolumn	: a two column article. Probably not needed, but here just in case.
%   onecolumn	: a one column article; default option.
%   twocolappendix: make 2 column appendix
%   onecolappendix: make 1 column appendix is the default.
%   astrosymb	: Loads Astrosymb font and define \astrocommands.
%   tighten	: Makes baselineskip slightly smaller
%   times	: uses times font instead of the default
%   linenumbers	: turn on lineno package.
%   trackchanges : required to see the revision mark up and print output
%   numberedappendix: Labels appendix sections A, B, ... This is the default.
%   appendixfloats: Needed. Resets figure and table counters to zero

%% these can be used in any combination, e.g.
%%
%% \documentclass[twocolumn,twocolappendix,linenumbers,trackchanges]{aastex6}

%% If you want to create your own macros, you can do so
%% using \newcommand. Your macros should appear before
%% the \begin{document} command.
%%
\newcommand{\vdag}{(v)^\dagger}
\newcommand\aastex{AAS\TeX}
\newcommand\latex{La\TeX}

%% AASTeX 6.0 supports the ability to suppress the names and affiliations
%% of some authors and displaying them under a "collaboration" banner to
%% minimize the amount of author information that to be printed.  This
%% should be reserved for articles with an extreme number of authors.
%%
%% Mark up commands to limit the number of authors on the front page.
\AuthorCallLimit=1
%% Will only show Schwarz & Muench since Schwarz and Muench
%% are in the same \author call.
\fullcollaborationName{The Friends of AASTeX Collaboration}
%% will print the collaboration text after the shortened author list.
%% These commands have to COME BEFORE the \author calls.
%%
%% Note that all of these author will be shown in the published article.
%% This feature is meant to be used prior to acceptance to make the
%% front end of a long author article more manageable.
%% Use \allauthors at the manuscript end to show the full author list.

%% The following command can be used to set the latex table counters.  It
%% is needed in this document because it uses a mix of latex tabular and
%% AASTeX deluxetables.  In general it should not be needed.
%\setcounter{table}{1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%
%% The following commented section outlines numerous optional output that
%% can be displayed in the front matter or as running meta-data.
%%
%% You can insert a short comment on the title page using the command below.
%% \slugcomment{Not to appear in Nonlearned J., 45.}
%%
%% If you wish, you may supply running head information, although
%% this information may be modified by the editorial offices.
%%\shorttitle{\aastex sample article}
%%\shortauthors{Schwarz et al.}
%%
%% You can add a light gray and diagonal water-mark to the first page
%% with this command:
%% \watermark{text}
%% where "text", e.g. DRAFT, is the text to appear.  If the text is
%% long you can control the water-mark size with:
%% \setwatermarkfontsize{dimension}
%% where dimension is any recognized LaTeX dimension, e.g. pt, in, etc.
%%

%% This is the end of the preamble.  Indicate the beginning of the
%% paper itself with \begin{document}.

\begin{document}

%% LaTeX will automatically break titles if they run longer than
%% one line. However, you may use \\ to force a line break if
%% you desire.

\title[]{Title}

%% Use \author, \affil, plus the \and command to format author and affiliation
%% information.  If done correctly the peer review system will be able to
%% automatically put the author and affiliation information from the manuscript
%% and save the corresponding author the trouble of entering it by hand.
%%
%% The \affil should be used to document primary affiliations and the
%% \altaffil should be used for secondary affiliations, titles, or email.

%% Authors with the same affiliation can be grouped in a single
%% \author and \affil call.
\author{Chong-Chong He\altaffilmark{1}}
\affil{Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742-2421}

%\and
%
%\author{Butler Burton\altaffilmark{2}}
%\affil{National Radio Astronomy Observatory}

%% Notice that each of these authors has alternate affiliations, which
%% are identified by the \altaffilmark after each name.  Specify alternate
%% affiliation information with \altaffiltext, with one command per each
%% affiliation.

%% Mark off the abstract in the ``abstract'' environment.
\begin{abstract}
abstract here. ss
\end{abstract}

%\keywords{}

%% From the front matter, we move on to the body of the paper.
%% Sections are demarcated by \section and \subsection, respectively.
%% Observe the use of the LaTeX \label
%% command after the \subsection to give a symbolic KEY to the
%% subsection for cross-referencing in a \ref command.
%% You can use LaTeX's \ref and \label commands to keep track of
%% cross-references to sections, equations, tables, and figures.
%% That way, if you change the order of any elements, LaTeX will
%% automatically renumber them.

%% We recommend that authors also use the natbib \citep
%% and \citet commands to identify citations.  The citations are
%% tied to the reference list via symbolic KEYs. The KEY corresponds
%% to the KEY in the \bibitem in the reference list below.

\section{Introduction}

%% Include this line if you are using the \added, \replaced, \deleted
